## Special Notes

- With the Youtube Data API you are awarded with 10,000 points of requests. For one video upload it costs 1605 points, regardless of file size, which calculates to about 6 uploads daily. Once you have exhausted your daily points, you have to wait till daily reset. Resets happens at 0:00 PST, i.e. 12:30 IST. So make your uploads count.

- Uploading copyright contents will leads to immediate blocking of the video.

- By default, all the videos are uploaded as private with random category id unless you provide `UPLOAD_MODE` and `VIDEO_CATEGORY`. You may change it after youtube processes the video.
